              <strong><em>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the
              core learning?</em></strong>
            </p>
        
            <p>
              I tend to overthink and put pressure, the result of overthinking on myself.
              Also, I let others' opinions louder than mine, easily taking in their thoughts
              on me without questioning, letting them define me. One thing I have noticed is
              that I would find myself in a chaotic mental state if I worry too much about
              what others think of me and am surrounded by things and people I am not familiar
              with. I would tend to rush things through and make lots of mistakes.
              Procrastination has been a serious problem. I used it to cope with a lack of
              confidence, delaying failures. But it also delays success and completion.

            <p>
              <strong><em></em>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              They let you know where to place yourself and show you the direction. Values,
              empathy, and self-awareness are critical for building reciprocal relationships
              and positive communication. During learning and programming, we will need to
              cooperate. Therefore, it is beneficial for the team to listen to and understand
              each other's points of view, take in advice, respect one another, and stand on
              their ground if necessary.

              <strong><em>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
             </em></strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              It's ok to be easy on myself and take baby steps.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong><em>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</em></strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Knowing myself. It is like mind anatomy, where you need to be honest with
              yourself. It can be painful sometimes as I'm used to avoiding those problems.
              But I'm glad I started the process, facing and acknowledging their existence.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong><em>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on
              core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</em></strong>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Human skills are equally important as technical skills in employment as the
              study materials mentioned. Employers can hire people with the skill sets they
              need, but not just the skills and knowledge. Employers are not only looking for
              people with good grades. But also what is in the candidate, such as vales,
              mindset, personalities which can be brought to the working place and enhance the
              team later on.

              <strong><em>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
              Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify
              your answer.</em></strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              Not at all. It's rather therapeutic. As we all should spend time getting to
              study and know better about ourselves. Along with working and communicating with
              others effectively. It will benefit us not just career-wise but for lifetime.
