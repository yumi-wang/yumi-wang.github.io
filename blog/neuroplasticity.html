                <strong><em>What is Neuroplasticity</em></strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                The term "neuroplasticity" (or "brain plasticity") refers to the
                ability of our brains to reorganize, both physically and
                functionally, throughout our lives, due to our environment. In
                short, it refers to the brain's ability to change itself.

              <p>
                <strong>Use It or Lose It:</strong> failure to drive specific
                brain functions can lead to loss of abilities.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Use It and Improve It:</strong> training that drives a
                specific brain function can lead to an enhancement of that
                function.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Repetition:</strong> repetition of a learned (or
                re-learned) behavior is required for long-term changes in the
                brain. You need thousands of repetitions to master a skill. The
                more time you spend practicing, the better you perform.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Intensity:</strong> induction of plasticity requires
                sufficient training intensity.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Salience:</strong> emotions can affect the strength of
                memory consolidation.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Transference:</strong> training one specific skill can
                sometimes activate the pathways of nearby, untrained items and
                improve those skills as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                Understanding the principles allowing us to be confident about
                improving the brain's ability into engaging and acquiring know
                knowledge and experience. It challenges the limits we set for
                ourselves or by society. To use the brain and challenge yourself
                frequently, you will find out how powerful your brain is, and
                there are so many things we can achieve that we did not dare to
                believe.
              </p>

              <p>
                Knowing the principle of neuroplasticity helps me understand our
                brain can be "shaped" and "sharpened". It also give me
                confidence to believe in myself. As I now know it takes time,
                practise, and repetition to gain a skill set. Constantly
                learning can help my brain become more adaptable and capable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Constantly learning and absorbing new information and knowledge.
                Always use my brain and expose myself to an information-rich
                environment. The stimulation of all kinds of activities can
                strengthen neural connections over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Repeate and stick to it. When I just started learning Japanese,
                the word “sunflower” was so difficult for me. So I repeated it
                around a hundred times. And now I can never forget it even I
                stopped learning the language for 5 years. Practicing frequently
                and consistently is the key.
              </p>

                <strong><em>What is Growth Mindset</em></strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                A growth mindset is that individuals who believe their talents
                can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input
                from others).
              </p>

              <p>
                People with a growth mindset are more likely to achieve more
                than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their
                talents are innate gifts). A “growth mindset” thrives on
                challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but
                as a heartening springboard for growth and stretching our
                existing abilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                We need to understand this because sometimes we might experience
                Imposter Syndrome (it is defined as doubting your abilities and
                feeling like a fraud) even when we are actually doing alright.
                Having a hard time understanding or failing a couple of times
                can be scary. But that does not define us and definitely does
                not mean we can't do it ever. Accepting the fact that the
                knowledge is new to us and may be challenging, having faith in
                ourselves, and knowing how much more we will learn and grow in
                this process can help us ease the nerves and build the
                confidence to achieve the goal.
              </p>

                <strong><em>Inspiration of Growth Mindset</em></strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                In order to do everything perfectly and not make any mistakes, I
                sometimes avoid doing it from the beginning. But this
                exploration has me realise that failure is not the end. It is
                just another challenge and a great moment to reflect on for
                further exploration and development. It definitely changed my
                mindset. And made me become braver and able to embrace failure
                and imperfection.

              <p>
                Instead of feeling stressed or anxious, think that it is normal
                when learning new things. Just like the muscle soreness after
                training, it lets you know you are doing the right thing. Face
                the challenges and the unknown, and soon they will be my strong
                armour and shield. Once before, a teacher told us it is a good
                thing if we feel tired running up a hill. That means we are
                practising and learning because gravity is working on us. There
                is no pain lying down, and there is no gain. I will be more open
                to the "gravity" and use it as a stepping stone for my learning
                journey.
