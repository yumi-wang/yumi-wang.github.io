                <strong><em>What is Neuroplasticity?</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                The term "neuroplasticity" (or "brain plasticity") refers to the ability of our brains to reorganize, both physically and functionally, throughout our lives, due to our environment. In short, it refers to the brain's ability to change itself.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><em>Principles of Neuroplasticity and Why it is important</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                Use It or Lose It
                <br />Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to functional degradation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Use It and Improve It
                <br />Training that drives a specific brain function can lead to an enhancement of that function.
              </p>

              <p>
                Specificity
                <br />The nature of the training experience dictates the nature of the plasticity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Repetition
                <br />Matters Induction of plasticity requires sufficient repetition.
              </p>

              <p>
                Intensity Matters
                <br />Induction of plasticity requires sufficient training intensity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Time Matters
                <br />Different forms of plasticity occur at different times during training.
              </p>

              <p>
                Salience Matters
                <br />The training experience must be sufficiently salient to induce plasticity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Age Matters
                <br />Training-induced plasticity occurs more readily in younger brains. However, neuroplasticity absolutely occurs in adulthood too! In fact, at any age, we have the potential to learn new skills or re-learn lost skills.

              </p>

              <p>
                Transference
                <br />Plasticity in response to one training experience can enhance the acquisition of similar behaviours.
              </p>

              <p>
                Interference
                <br />Plasticity in response to one experience can interfere with the acquisition of other behaviours.
              </p>

              <p>
                Understanding the principles allowing us to be confident about improving the brain's ability into engaging and acquiring know knowledge and experience. It challenges the limits we set for ourselves or by society. To use the brain and challenge yourself frequently, you will find out how powerful your brain is, and there are so many things we can achieve that we did not dare to believe.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><em>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                Constantly learning and absorbing new information and knowledge. Always use my brain and expose myself to an information-rich environment. The stimulation of all kinds of activities can strengthen neural connections over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Repete and stick to it. When I just started learning Japanese, the word “sunflower” was so difficult for me. So I repeated it around a hundred times. And now I can never forget it even I stopped learning the language for 5 years. Frequently and consistently Practicing is the key.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><em>What is Growth Mindset?</em></strong> 
              </p>
              
              <p>
                a growth mindset is that Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others).
              </p>

              <p>
                People with a growth mindset are more likely to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). A “growth mindset” thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><em>Inspiration of Growth Mindset?</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                In order to do everything perfectly and not make any mistakes, I sometimes avoid doing it from the beginning. As there is no such thing, there is no failure. But failure is not the end. It is just another challenge and a great moment to reflect on for further exploration and development. Be brave and dare to be wrong is something I will put in practice.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><em>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                Always believe in myself.
              </p>
                  
              <p>
                Don't get intimidated by the difficulties.
              </p>

              <p>
                Never give up.
              </p>

              <p>
                Welcome challenges and feedbacks.
              </p>

              <p>
                Make peace with failure.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong><em>Blend with your learning plan and strategies?</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                Instead of feeling stressed, think that it is normal when learning new things. Just like the muscle sore after training, it let you know you are doing the right thing. Face the challenges and the unknown, soon they will be my strong armor and shield.
