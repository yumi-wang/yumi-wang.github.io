                <strong><em> The problem I encountered</em></strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                The problem I was facing was Buzz buzz buZZ.
                <br />What I needed to do was get rid of the word “buzz”
                regardless of capitalization in the sentence [Buzz BUzz BuZZ
                help BUZZ buzz]. I wanted to use the filter method to filter out
                all the buzzes so only the word “help” will stay. But I got
                blocked by what to filter. For example, if you want to only look
                up meat when you do online grocery shopping, you put “Meat &
                Seafood” in the filter. And you will only see products that meet
                the condition you put in which are meat and seafood on your web
                page. I understood the result I wanted to get and the method I
                needed to use, but I was lost in finding the connection between
                them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The problem-solving techniques I used were reading error message
                and asking for help. The aha moment was when I read the error
                message that told me what was expected and what was the result
                of my code. It let me see the outcome was “buzz buzz buzz buzz
                buzz”. So I got it immediately that I was doing the opposite
                thing. I put “buzz” in the filter, so only “buzz” stayed. I
                changed the condition in the filter that was everything that
                doesn't equal “buzz”.
              </p>

              <p>
                I felt a bit defeated and anxious throughout the process. I was
                lost in the logic flow and didn't see the whole picture. What I
                learned here is to do it step by step, and find out what went
                wrong. Knowing the method used to solve the problem is not
                everything. I also need to know working theory and use reverse
                thinking. The feedback is essential as well. Just like the
                doctor can only help their patients when knowing what kind of
                disease they are tackling.

                <strong><em> Elegantly solved a problem</em></strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                The problem was "We built this city". At first I had trouble
                undestandinging the requirements and wasn't sure what to do.
                <br />I tried Pseudocode and Reading test messages to figure out
                what I needed to achieve. And what should be included and the
                types of certain elements. I also tried Console.logging to see
                the results and what is lacking, and what went wrong. From that,
                I used Googling to find methods to solve the problem.
              </p>

              <p>
                I felt confident throughout the process as I know exactly what
                to do step by step. And I can see what went wrong if it wasn't
                working.
                <br />I learned it is important to break big things down into
                small pieces and solve them step by step in a logical way. Also,
                feedbacks such as reading error messages helps to locate the
                problem, saving time and effort to go through things all over
                again. Last but not least, searching skills are crucial in
                problem-solving, especially with the error messages we get.

                Pseudocode
                <br />Pseudocode is an informal language that programmers use to
                create an outline or a rough draft of a program. <br />I used it
                to be clear about what needs to be tackled and the methods and
                steps that will lead me to it. I tend to work things out in my
                head or write them down somewhere by hand. And I need more
                practise on Pseudocode.
              </p>

              <p>
                Trying something
                <br />Problem-solving is about trying something out. I
                constantly try different methods and ways to get the code
                working. It is a effective way for me to practice and know what
                works and what doesn't. And most importantly why. I feel
                confident using this method.

                Rubber ducky method The method is referred to as a think-aloud
                protocol. Programmers explain the problem out loud to get your
                brain into problem-solving mode. When they talk to a rubber
                duck, they can get a better idea of their thought processes and
                gain a deeper understanding of their work.
                <br />For me to be qualified to use the method I need a Rubber
                ducky XD. But speaking to myself is more affordable. I walk
                through the requirement with myself or sometimes with my
                partner. And then ask myself in order to achieve that, what
                methods or functions do I need? Then I will try out the ways
                till I get a pass message. Rubber ducky method is useful for me
                and I will practise more.

                Reading error messages
                <br />The error messages are helpful to spot the problem and
                show a direction into solving it. <br />I used this method a
                lots and found it very helpful in terms of what and where went
                wrong. It helps googling as I now have the key words which
                narrow down the range. I need to do more study to undertand
                about the error types.
              </p>

              <p>
                Console.logging
                <br />Console.logging allows programmers to read the code on a
                web page and therefore help to test the written code. <br />I
                love Console.logging as it shows the results of the code. And it
                gives me idea what is the different between the actual results
                and what is expected. I think I am becoming better in it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Googling
                <br />You can almost google everything, and get millions of
                answers. It is important that you know which one will suit the
                problem you encounter the most. <br />It is the most important
                method I reckon as I get help from people around the world and
                there is often a solution that works for the error that occured.
                Although I need to learn more about searching skills.
              </p>

                Asking your peers for help
                <br />It is always nice to get support from people who work on
                the same project as you. However, I have not had chance to as
                the problems I encounted are solved by previous methods. I will
                try this method in a near further.
              </p>

                Asking coaches for help
                <br />I did not use this method enough. I guess it can be hard
                sometimes to ask for help from the coaches as I do not want them
                to think I am asking silly questions. But through learning
                growth mindset, I came to realise it is a normal process that we
                feel inconpetent when strating new things. And I will do it more
                often.
              </p>

              <p>
                Improving your process with reflection
                <br />I often ask myself whether I can still solve the same
                problem without the answer and what are other methods I can use
                to improve my problem-solving skills. The most important thing
                is to make sense of the process and apply it to the problems you
                encounter.
