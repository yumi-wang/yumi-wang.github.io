                <strong><em> The problem I encountered</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                The problem I was facing was Buzz buzz buZZ.
                <br />What I needed to do was get rid of the word “buzz” regardless of capitalization in the sentence [Buzz BUzz BuZZ help BUZZ buzz]. I wanted to use the filter method to filter out all the buzzes so only the word “help” will stay. But I got blocked by what to filter. For example, if you want to only look up meat when you do online grocery shopping, you put “Meat & Seafood” in the filter. And you will only see products that meet the condition you put in which are meat and seafood on your web page. I understood the result I wanted to get and the method I needed to use, but I was lost in finding the connection between them. The aha moment was when I read the error message or the message that told me what was expected and what was the result of my code. It told me the outcome was “buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz”. So I got it immediately that I was doing the opposite thing. I put “buzz” in the filter, so only “buzz” stayed. I changed the condition in the filter that was everything that doesn't equal “buzz”.

                I was lost in the logic flow and didn't see the whole picture. What I learned here is to do it step by step, and find out what went wrong. Knowing the method used to solve the problem is not everything. I also need to know working theory and use reverse thinking. The feedback is essential as well. Just like the doctor can only help their patients when knowing what kind of disease they are tackling.

                <strong><em> Elegantly solved a problem</em></strong> 
              </p>

              <p>
                The problem was "We built this city". 
                <br />I tried Pseudocode and Reading test messages to figure out what I needed to achieve. And what should be included and the types of certain elements. I also tried Console.logging to see the results and what is lacking, and what went wrong. From that, I used Googling to find methods to solve the problem. 

              </p>

              <p>
                I felt confident throughout the process as I know exactly what to do step by step. And I can see what went wrong if it wasn't working. 
                <br />I learned it is important to break big things down into small things and solve them step by step in a logical way. Also, feedback such as reading error messages helps to locate the problem, saving time and effort to go through things all over again. Last but not least, searching skills are crucial in problem-solving, especially with the error messages we get.

                Pseudocode
                <br />Pseudocode is an informal language that programmers use to create an outline or a rough draft of a program.
                <br />I used it to be clear about what needs to be tackled and the methods and steps that will lead me to it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Trying something
                <br />Problem-solving is about trying something out. I constantly try different methods and ways to get the code working. It is a good way to practice and know what works and what doesn't. And most importantly why.
              </p>

              <p>
                Rubber ducky method
                <br />The method is referred to as a think-aloud protocol. Programmers explain the problem out loud to get your brain into problem-solving mode. When they talk to a rubber duck, they can get a better idea of their thought processes and gain a deeper understanding of their work.
                And I need a Rubber ducky to be qualified to use the method XD
              </p>

              <p>
                Reading error messages
                <br />The error messages are helpful to spot the problem and show a direction into solving it. <br />I used this method a lots and found it very helpful in terms of what and where went wrong. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Console.logging
                <br />Console.logging allows programmers to read the code on a web page and therefore help to test the written code.
                <br />I love Console.logging as it shows the results of the code. And it gives me idea what is the different between the actual results and what is expected. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Googling
                <br />You can almost google everything, and get millions of answers. It is important that you know which one will suit the problem you encounter the most. Again, it is not about getting the answer, it's to know how and why it resolved the problem.
                <br />It is the most important method I reckon as I get help from people around the world and there is often a solution that works for the error that occured.
              </p>

              <p>
                Asking your peers for help
                <br />It is always nice to get support from people who work on the same project as you. They might know the answer to it or have excellent ideas.
              </p>

              <p>
                Improving your process with reflection
                <br />I often ask myself whether I can still solve the same problem without the answer and what are other methods I can use to improve my problem-solving skills. The most important thing is to make sense of the process and apply it to the problems you encounter.
