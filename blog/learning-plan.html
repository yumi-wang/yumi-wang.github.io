                My goal is to be a confident programmer who offers support to
                others. I would like to take away the skills gained at dev
                academy as my asset to be a part of the tech field and land a
                job I enjoy. And maybe I will be an independent developer who
                brings convenience and joy to other people.
              </p>

                    What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations
                    will be in Bootcamp?

                </strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                My strengths and limitations pretty much remain the same as
                before. I believe I have the patience to absorb new concepts and
                tackle problems. When I get stuck, I do not usually suffer from
                negative feelings. Instead, I enjoy the process of looking for
                and trying out solutions. However, one limitation I did not
                mention is a lack of confidence. That might stop me from
                speaking up for myself or asking questions during Bootcamp.
              </p>

                </strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                Perhaps working with other people. I don't know if I can make
                myself clear and understood during group work or presentations.
                Also, working with people online is a lot more harder than in
                real life, in my opinion.

                Probably all of them, communication, teamwork, and leadership
                skills. I want to become a good and confident communicator and
                team member who is comfortable with speaking their mind, working
                with different people, and just open communication in general.

              </p>

              <p>
                I would expect technical and emotional support and feedback on
                my performance from the team. On top of that, as a bonus, I hope
                the team can also provide some inside information in terms of
                getting into the IT industry and what it is like or share some
                experience if possible.
              </p>

                I would be self-disciplined, productive, and respectful during
                my learning journey. I'm not a morning person, so I will try to
                stick to the schedule and have enough rest. For the workload, I
                will try not to overwork and listen to my body when it gets
                tired and needs a break. And of course, provided the work on the
                day can be done on time. When I get stuck, I will give myself
                half an hour to find an answer. And if I can't, I will seek help
                from others. Most importantly, be open, respectful and honest
                with other learners, facilitators, industry/community
                representatives, and myself.

                The best scenario is to set foot in the tech industry with the
                skills I have and will gain with Dev Academy. And learn new
                things along the way till I have enough experience to be a
                full-stack developer.

                Communication is something I have always struggled with. I would
                like to take this opportunity to learn how to make effective and
                reciprocal connections with people.<br />

                Other things I want to learn are stress management and time
                management. I tend to overthink and procrastinate, and they make
                each other worse. I hope I can develop a schedule and motivation
                to keep myself away from them through this experience.

                The best way is to focus on the study for a short amount of time
                and have a little break. Not scared of asking after researching.
                And help others if I know a way to solve their question.<br />

                If things start to get to me, I will have a break, clearing my
                mind. Also ask for support from my peers, facilitators, friends
                and family if necessary.
