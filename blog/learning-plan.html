                The best scenario is to set foot in the tech industry with the skills I have and will gain with Dev Academy. And learn new things along the way till I have enough experience to be a full-stack developer.

              </p>

              <p>
                Strengths: attention to detail and patience.<br />
                Limitations: communication and time management.

              <p>
                Communication is something I have always struggled with. I would like to take this opportunity to learn how to make effective and reciprocal connections with people.<br />

                Other things I want to learn are stress management and time management. I tend to overthink and procrastinate, and they make each other worse. I hope I can develop a schedule and motivation to keep myself away from them through this experience.

              <p>
                The best way is to focus on the study for a short amount of time and have a little break. Not scared of asking after researching. And help others if I know a way to solve their question.<br />

                If things start to get to me, I will have a break, clearing my mind. Also ask for support from my peers, facilitators, friends and family if necessary.

                I will be staying with my partner during the time of Bootcamp. And he is willing to provide the support I need.
