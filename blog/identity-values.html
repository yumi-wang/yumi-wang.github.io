                    Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

                During my time in college, a classmate made fun of a lecturer's accent. It was disrespectful, and I could have told him to stop. But I did not do anything as it felt unnecessary. An accent is a part of people's self-identity as it comes from their cultural background and mother tone. It is something we cannot change. And language is a way to get mutual understanding but discrimination. Respect has been my core value, and his comment made me uncomfortable.
                On the one hand, we were somewhat close as we share the same cultural background and language. It was hard to speak up as I didn't want to make things awkward. A part of it also has to do with me being a voider and afraid of conflicts. I made the decision in the easy way, not the right way. Now I think about it, I could have told him it is simply not funny.

                  <em>
                    Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.

                Growing up in a small city Nanning and being close to my whƒÅnau, I have developed an enormous love for my hometown and my family. In our culture, we value being around our parents and extended family. But I did the opposite, being over 10000km away from home. And it makes me appreciate my family and hometown more. Although I didn't go with their wishes, they still support me and love me unconditionally.

                  <em>
                    Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.

              <p>
                My strengths are attention to detail and patience. When I worked as an accountant, I liked to get every detail right from the beginning as I knew that it would be a massive workload if we only found the imbalance at the end.<br />                  
                I understand that programming languages are very precise. Missing a symbol or a wrong indention will cause a project to malfunction. That is when I can apply my strengths to the learning journey to minimise the possibility.

                <strong>
                  <em>
                    Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?

              </p>

              <p>
                I might be too good at spending time and communicating with myself, so I don't have enough practice building relationships with others. I would like to use my values to guide me in this time. 
              </p>

                    Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
                  </em>

              </p>

              <p>
                I have not encountered this situation before. If that were the case, I would try to understand the cause of the resistance or tension. And try to coordinate within the group to see what can be fixed. Also, to get help from superiors or outside of the group.
